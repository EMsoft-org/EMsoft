! ===================================
! the standard refinement approach uses the same pattern center for all patterns; this is 
! a reasonable approximation when the total scan area is of the order of the detector pixel
! size.  For larger scan areas, one must perform a pattern center correction.  This can 
! be turned on using the following parameter: (note that the refinement will take approximately 
! twice as long due to the two-pass nature of therefinement; see J. Appl. Cryst. (2017). 50, 1664â€“1676)
 PCcorrection = 'off',
! Pattern center correction requires knowledge of the pattern coordinates for which the 
! pattern center was originally refined. These are determined in units of the sampling step size.
! These would typically be the x, y coordinates used in the EMEBSDDIpreview program.
