function CBEDApply2DSymmetry,inp,iorder
;
; apply a series of basic 2D symmetry operations to the input array
;
common SYM2D, SYM_MATnum, SYM_direc
common CBED_data_common, data


; first of all, apply the identity operation, corrected for the point group orientation if necessary
if (data.thetam ne 0.0) then begin
  zinp = rot(inp,-data.thetam,cubic=-0.5)
end else begin
  zinp = inp
end

z = zinp

; then loop over all the symmetry operators
for i=1,SYM_MATnum-1 do begin
  z += CBEDApply2DOperator(zinp,i)
endfor

; and rotate back to the original orientation if necessary
if (data.thetam ne 0.0) then begin
  z = rot(z,data.thetam,cubic=-0.5)
end 

; and return the array, properly normalized to avoid double counting
return,z
end
