;--------------------------------------------------------------------------
pro CBEDprosetvalue, wid, widval

; by default, this routine has to two 4 things (see IDL manual)
; 1. Process the Value supplied to the procedure in the necessary way
; 2. Unset the PRO_SET_VALUE keyword for the affected widget by setting its value to a null string
; 3. Set the affected widget's value using the SET_VALUE keyword to WIDGET_CONTROL
; 4. Reset the PRO_SET_VALUE keyword to the original procedure
; the reason for this is that if we do not unset, the keyword, then this routine 
; would start calling itself in an infinite loop ...

; 1.  nothing needs to be done here

; 2.
WIDGET_CONTROL, PRO_SET_VALUE='', wid

; 3.
WIDGET_CONTROL, SET_VALUE = widval, wid

; 4.
WIDGET_CONTROL, PRO_SET_VALUE='CBEDprosetvalue', wid


end
