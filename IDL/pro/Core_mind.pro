function Core_mind,ndhist,level=level
;
; computes the mutual information for a set of n images
;
; input: the normalized n-dimensional histogram, as computed by new_hist_nd(array,binsize,/normalize)
;
; output: the higher dimensional mutual information
;
; The idea is that we compute the n-dimensional joint histogram only once,
; and then project it down into lower dimensions for the computation of 
; all the image entropies...
;
; This routine calls itself recursively with the lower dimensional joint histograms
; as input ...
