!
!> @details  
!> physical and mathematical constants used by various programs; periodic
!>  table information; atomic weights; 
!
!> @note mod 5.1: f90wrap does not like arrays of parameters (constants), so we removed the 'parameter' attribute
!>  in all those cases... we should trust that the user will not modify the values in these arrays...
! 
!> @date 1/5/99   MDG 1.0 original
!> @date 5/18/01  MDG 2.0 f90
!> @date 11/27/01 MDG 2.1 added kind support
!> @date 03/19/13 MDG 3.0 added atomic weights 
!> @date 01/10/14 MDG 4.0 new version
!> @date 04/29/14 MDG 4.1 constants updated from NIST physical constants tables
!> @date 07/06/14 MDG 4.2 added omegamax to Lambert constant type
!> @date 08/11/14 MDG 4.3 added infty for handling of +Infinity in rotations module
!> @date 08/11/14 MDG 4.4 added epsijk option to package
!> @date 09/30/14 MDG 4.5 added some additional comments about epsijk
!> @date 10/02/14 MDG 4.6 removed omegamax again, since we now have properly dealt with 180 degree rotations
!> @date 03/11/15 MDG 4.7 added some additional comments about epsijk 
!> @date 04/02/17 MDG 4.8 modified definition of fundamental zones types and orders to accomodate two-phase disorientations
!> @date 10/24/17 MDG 4.9 removed definition of infty and inftyd to be replaced by functions in math.f90 module
!> @date 01/04/18 MDG 5.0 added quasicrystal constant IcoVertices
!> @date 09/01/19 MDG 5.1 remove 'parameter' attribute to allow for f90wrap python wrapping of parameter arrays...

! used to change the sign of the permutation symbol from Adam Morawiec's book to
! the convention used for the EMsoft package.  If you want to use Adam's convention,
! both of these parameters should be set to +1; -1 will change the sign everywhere
! for all representations that involve the unit vector.  The quaternion product is 
! also redefined to include the epsijk parameter.  Doing so guarantees that the 
! quat_Lp operator ALWAYS returns an active result, regardless of the choice of epsijk;
! quat_LPstar ALWAYS returns a passive result.

! Uncomment these for an alternative way of doing things
!real(kind=sgl), parameter :: epsijk = -1.0
!real(kind=dbl), parameter :: epsijkd = -1.D0

! uncomment these for the Morawiec version.

! In the first case, epsijk=-1, the rotation 120@[111] will result in 
! an axis angle pair of [111], 2pi/3.  In the second case, the axis-angle 
! pair will be -[111], 2pi/3.  In all cases, the rotations are interpreted
! in the passive sense.  The case epsijk=+1 corresponds to the mathematically 
! consistent case, using the standard definition for the quaternion product; in
! the other case, epsijk=-1, one must redefine the quaternion product in order
! to produce consistent results.  This takes a lengthy explanation ... see the
! rotations tutorial paper for an in-depth explanation.  These changes propagate
! to a number of files, notably quaternions.f90, and everywhere else that quaternions
! and rotations in general are used.
