!> @date 08/01/16  SS 1.0 original
!> @date 03/12/18 MDG 1.1 replaced HDF5 dot product file reading by subroutine call
!> @date 04/01/18 MDG 2.0 merged various versions of the orientation fit/refine into a single program
!> @date 11/19/18 MDG 2.1 correction of bug caused by incorrectly initialized CIlist array
